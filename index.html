        <p class="dos"> Wet Water. The water that everyone drinks. It tastes like water thats wet. When you spill a glass of wet water you get wet, but the water itself isnt wet. </p>

        <p class="tres"> School water. Tastes like the unholy combination of a bald head and Baby by Justin Bieber. Contains half the germs found in a subway station. If you're desperate and lucky it'll do its job, if you have Johnson's luck go to the nurse after drinking.</p>
